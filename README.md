The purpose of this program is to print a receipt for the user based on the information they provided for the item they'd like to purchase. 

We are used to prompt the user (user input) to enter information. 
Next, we will conceal the information the user enters (such as credit/debit card info)

This program allows the potential user to see their receipt for their purchase.

<+s>: In this program, I understood how to use replace when replacing numbers with special characters. 
However, it was still unclear and I will need more practice. 

<-s>: With practice, I will be able to fully understand how to work this program.

Understanding this info will help me in the future. 

I learned how to display the first letter of the user's first name using the material taught in class. 
I could improve a bit so I can do better in the future.
